<!-- Component element defines the name of the component and the type of node whose behavior it extends.
This is the base node which handles home screen children.
Also this is the place where XSD is included. XSD requires that the order of elements be deterministic, 
and so for validation to work, Scene Graph node elements must be contained in an element themselves). -->

            onChange - Sets an observer call-back function to be added for the top-level field.
                       The value of the attribute is a call-back function name in BrightScript code associated with the component. 
                       This attribute is provided as a quick way to set up an observer call-back function for top-level fields.
                       It is equivalent to calling ObserveField() in BrightScript code associated with the component.-->
